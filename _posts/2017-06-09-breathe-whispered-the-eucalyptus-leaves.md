[Get creating with this fresh & earthy Eucalyptus ebook template][0]

"Breathe", whispered the eucalyptus leaves. 

That's what I heard when I picked them up from the local market last weekend.

They went on to inspire this ebook template with their silvery-blue leaves sitting on our wooden dining table.

Perfect for the entrepreneur who likes a mix of calm, earthy and fresh aesthetics.

So you have something you'd like to share with the world.

Be it a PDF eBook of your best business advice in exchange for emails, or a brochure listing your current services.

When you're starting out, it's tough to find designers, much less find the right one at the right price. 

Just because you're on a budget doesn't mean you have to compromise on quality.

This is why I created these fully customisable templates for entrepreneurs and small business owners.

⟢ Super easy to use -- just add your content!! 

⟢ Unique, clean and minimalist styles. 

⟢ Over 8 page styles in total to suit any layout needs.

⟢ Fonts and colours are fully editable.

Link to Google Docs will be sent, DOCX format for Word in Windows and Mac Pages are also available at request. Google Docs is recommended, I use it all the time! :)

Best for image-rich eBooks, not recommended for multiple-page text blocks.

7-day friendly support available.

What they say:

Caressa Thompson 

"If you're anything like me, design is not my strong-suit and templates save me every time. Gretchen, has provided me templates that are easy to use and get started using ASAP. I love that the templates are in Google Drive as every aspect is customizable to fit my brand. On top of it all, she's readily available to answer all of my questions & has the most warm personality! Highly recommend Gretchen's templates"

Sabrina Phillip

"Gretchen's templates are both beautiful and functional. I was struggling to design something that represented my brand and would still inspire readers. These templates made it super easy for me to put together a great product and focus on my work."

Amanda Helena

"I was inspired to work with Gretchen as I wanted a more professional look to an ebook resource I give my clients when they sign up to my program. I had created it myself and the lack of design to it was a little embarrassing. It was purely functional. I was so impressed with the time Gretchen took to understand my brand. She was so thorough in her preparation, which showed me the care and attention she puts into creating something unique for each client. What she produced was such a huge improvement! It totally elevated the degree of professionalism of my resource. Best of all, she went above and beyond and created two versions in a different programs that I could easily modify so I can update the content of my resource with ease. Super happy. Thanks Gretchen!"
